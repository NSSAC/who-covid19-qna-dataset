The first known laboratory-confirmed case of Omicron was identified from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021 in South Africa, with the variant (Pango nomenclature B.1.1.529) first reported to WHO on 24 November. In consultation with the Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE), WHO designated B.1.1.529 as a VOC on 26 November in view of the potential for enhanced transmissibility and/or a degree of immune escape, given the number of mutations (26-32) in the spike protein, as well as concerning initial epidemiological reports from South Africa, including signals of increased risk of reinfection. Here, we present an update on the current situation in terms of the epidemiology and transmissibility, clinical severity, risk of reinfection and the potential impact on diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics. As more data are analysed and understood about the potential implications that Omicron may have on the epidemiology, transmissibility, clinical severity, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our understanding of this variant will continue to evolve, and we will issue updates as further evidence becomes available.

In WHO’s most recent global rapid risk assessment, conducted on 07 January 2022, the global public health risk was assessed as remaining very high. Under the Emergency Response Framework, WHO undertakes risk assessments and situation analyses on a regular basis to inform our response to emerging situations. In addition, WHO periodically reviews the current risk status of ongoing public health events through an in-depth hazard, exposure and context assessment. This also includes a review of the vulnerabilities and capacities available to respond to the public health event and to investigate the current risk to human health, risks of ongoing global spread, and the risk of insufficient control capacities. Such assessments are used as an internal WHO decision-making tool, and to support independent deliberations, including but not limited to, meetings of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee for the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, 13 global rapid risk assessments have been undertaken for COVID-19, and additional assessments have been conducted for specific events such as the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we provide a synopsis of the most recent   global rapid risk assessment for COVID-19 which covers the period from mid-October to the end of December 2021 and was finalised on 7 January 2022.  Since the last risk assessment, the incidence of COVID-19 has increased globally, initially driven predominantly by transmission of the Delta variant, particularly in the European Region. Subsequently, following the identification of the Omicron variant in South Africa, reported to WHO on 24 November 2021, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of cases in the African Region. This has been followed by increases in the other WHO Regions in weeks 51 (20-26 December 2021) and 52 (27 December 2021 to 2 January 2022). In contrast, a global decline has been seen for COVID-19 mortality since a peak in August 2021. Nonetheless, a combination of the increased and rapid spread of the Omicron variant, increased population movements and social mixing during and after the end of year holiday period and challenges with ongoing adherence to public health and social measures (PHSM) are expected to lead to increased number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the coming weeks.  On 26 November, WHO designated Omicron as the fifth SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC) due to its large number of mutations, evidence indicative of a detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology and potential for increased risk of reinfection.

As evidence becomes available, classification for VOIs or VOCs will be revised to reflect the continuous evolution of circulating variants and their changing epidemiology. Criteria for variant classification, and the current lists of VOCs, VOIs and other Variants Under Monitoring, are available on the WHO Tracking SARS-Cov-2 variants website. National authorities may choose to designate other variants of local interest/concern and are encouraged to investigate and report on impacts of these variants.  Geographic spread and prevalence of VOCs  The current global genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a predominance of the Delta variant, with declining prevalence of other variants among sequences submitted to publicly available datasets or detections reported to WHO (Figure 4, Annex 2). Delta has outcompeted other variants, including other VOCs, in most countries. Of 842 510 sequences uploaded to GISAID with specimens collected in the last 60 daysa, 838 398 (99.5%) were Delta, 1545 (0.2%) Gamma, 584 (0.1%) Alpha, 43 (<0.1%) Beta, and 0.2% comprised other circulating variants (including VOIs Mu and Lambda). Sub-regional and country-level variation continues to be observed; most notably within some South American countries, where the progression of the Delta variant has been more gradual, and other variants (e.g., Gamma, Lambda, Mu) still contribute a large proportion of reported sequences. Moreover, global VOCs distribution should be interpreted with due consideration of surveillance limitations, including differences in sequencing capacities, sampling strategies between countries and delays in reporting.  Phenotypic characteristics Available evidence on the phenotypic impacts of VOCs is summarized in Table 2, as well as in previous editions of the COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update. Since the last detailed update on 19 October, there are several new publications on the phenotypic characteristics of VOCs.

433,PB,SV,0,Drop this since it is NA," How does the use of GIS contribute to health emergency response? When applied to public health, GIS can analyse the spatial distribution of health outcomes and risk factors, to identify, prevent and control diseases, and improve the impact of health interventions. For example, GIS is easily integrated with demographic data, and can also help achieve equitable vaccine distribution and access to care. GIS also enables the spatial representation of data to support better public health planning and decision-making.  In health emergencies, GIS can support the identification of disease clusters and their possible causes, improve deployment for emergency services, determine if an area is being served adequately by health services, and support operational decision-making in other ways. GIS can also visualise and communicate spatial data intuitively to a wide variety of audiences in a timely manner. The effective use of GIS can strengthen countries’ capacities to detect and respond to health emergencies. For many years, WHO and partners have employed GIS to support the response to health emergencies, including outbreaks of Ebola virus disease, polio, measles, Zika virus disease, yellow fever, plague and cholera, as well as natural disasters and humanitarian crises such as famine and armed conflicts. The use of GIS can be adapted depending on the scale of the emergency and the extent of the affected areas. For example, GIS can support a local response by analysing the space-time travel patterns of patients to efficiently allocate available health screening resources, identifying the location of health facilities, and delineating health administrative boundaries to better understand healthcare accessibility in areas where there were previously sparse or inaccurate data. Mapping environmental factors related to disease, such as the distribution of disease-carrying mosquitoes, can inform risk assessments. At a regional or global level, GIS can inform data-driven decision-making by consolidating and presenting the epidemiological situation in multiple countries through GIS dashboards. WHO has drawn upon the knowledge accumulated in past health emergencies to strengthen the COVID-19 response. ",,

Evidence from multiple countries with extensive transmission of VOCs has indicated that the implementation of PHSM and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in health facilities has been effective in reducing COVID-19 case incidence, which has led to a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among COVID-19 patients. Findings from new studies evaluating transmission, severity and impact on medical countermeasures will continue to help inform PHSM and IPC measures employed by Member States.

The primary source of evidence about the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in any geographic location is the testing of upper respiratory tract samples. However, in an increasing number of settings around the world, routine COVID-19 surveillance programmes have supplemented diagnostic testing with community-scale environmental surveillance (ES) of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples.   Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, ES to detect circulating pathogens in wastewater had been used extensively in public health, particularly for poliovirus3, typhoid4,5 and more recently antimicrobial resistance (AMR).6  On 14 April 2022, WHO released interim guidance on Environmental surveillance for SARS-COV-2 to complement public health surveillance in order to provide Member States with advice on how to establish an effective ES programme for SARS-CoV-2. This includes the minimum requirements for planning and coordinating ES in different resource settings and good practice for data collection, analysis, interpretation and communication.  Applications of environmental surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 Leadership by the public health agencies responsible for the overall COVID-19 response is critical for SARS-COV-2 ES programmes. Health authorities in charge of infectious disease surveillance should have the responsibility to design ES for SARS-CoV-2, coordinate interpretation and communicate findings.  At their most basic, SARS-CoV-2 ES programmes indicate whether, at the level of the community, the virus is above (present) or below (absent) the limits of detection of the testing methods used. This is particularly relevant in zero- or low-prevalence settings to confirm the absence of virus circulation or warn about the (re)emergence of the virus. Most ES programmes in high prevalence settings involve quantification of results to identify trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. In the most advanced settings, SARS-COV-2 ES programmes can detect emerging variants and monitor circulating variants. These findings can then help target SARS-CoV-2 responses and interventions.","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, ES to detect circulating pathogens in wastewater had been used extensively in public health to detect which pathogens?","poliovirus3, typhoid4,5 and more recently antimicrobial resistance (AMR)."

1198,SD,SV,1,up to 50%,"For many infectious pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, good hand hygiene practices are tremendously important for reducing the risk of transmission, as part of a wider package of public health and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. Launched in 2009 and celebrated annually on 5 May, World Hand Hygiene Day (WHHD) aims to promote visibility and sustainability of hand hygiene in healthcare, and to bring people together in support of hand hygiene improvement around the world. This year, in the Year of Health and Care Workers, WHHD 2021 focuses on achieving effective hand hygiene action at the point of care and redouble our efforts to ensure that hand hygiene is a priority for action.  Health workers, patients and families, infection prevention and control practitioners, health facility managers, policy-makers, vaccinators and the general public all have an important role to play and are encouraged to practice good hand hygiene, because:  • Appropriate hand hygiene reduces the risk of infection from many pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, both in the general population1 and among health workers.2 • Appropriate hand hygiene prevents up to 50% of avoidable infections acquired during health care delivery. 3 • Investing in hand hygiene yields huge returns – hand hygiene policies can generate economic savings averaging 16 times the cost of their implementation. 4 • Effective hand hygiene reduces mortality and disabilities due to health care-associated infections.",Appropriate hand hygiene prevents up to how much percent of avoidable infections acquired during health care delivery?,"50%
